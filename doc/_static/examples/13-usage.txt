           template subject

positional arguments:
  template
  subject

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --lowpass LOW_THRESH,HIGH_THRESH
                        1,1 means no-op, 0.8,0.9 is a mild filter
  --highpass LOW_THRESH,HIGH_THRESH
                        0,0 means no-op, 0.1,0.2 is a mild filter
  --cut LOW_THRESH,HIGH_THRESH
                        Cap values of the image according to quantile values.
                        0,1 means no-op, 0.01,0.99 is a mild filter
  --resample RESAMPLE   Work with resampled images.
  --iters ITERS         How many iterations to guess the right scale and angle
  --extend PIXELS       Extend images by the specified amount of pixels before
                        the processing (thus eliminating edge effects)
  --order ORDER         Interpolation order (1 = linear, 3 = cubic etc)
  --filter-pcorr FILTER_PCORR
                        Whether to filter during translation detection.
                        Normally not needed, but when using low-pass
                        filtering, you may need to increase filter radius (0
                        means no filtering, 4 should be enough)
  --print-result        We don't print anything unless this option is
                        specified
  --print-format PRINT_FORMAT
                        Print a string (to stdout) in a given format. A
                        dictionary containing the 'scale', 'angle', 'tx',
                        'ty', 'Dscale', 'Dangle', 'Dt' and 'success' keys will
                        be passed for string interpolation
  --tile                If the template is larger than the subject, break the
                        template to pieces of size similar to subject size.
  --version             Just print version and exit
  --angle MEAN[,STD]    The mean and standard deviation of the expected angle.
  --scale MEAN[,STD]    The mean and standard deviation of the expected scale.
  --tx MEAN[,STD]       The mean and standard deviation of the expected X
                        translation.
  --ty MEAN[,STD]       The mean and standard deviation of the expected Y
                        translation.
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Where to save the transformed subject.
  --loader {pil,mat,hdr}
                        Force usage of a concrete loader (default is
                        autodetection). If you plan on using two types of
                        loaders to load input, or save the output,
                        autodetection is the only way to achieve this.
  --loader-opts LOADER_OPTS
                        Options for a loader (use --loader to make sure that
                        one is used or read the docs.)
  --help-loader         Get help on all loaders or on the current loader and
                        its options.
  --show                Whether to show registration result
